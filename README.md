# FirstFightingGame
Really enjoyed making video games during my time in college, so I wanted to make another one with some combat this time. 
I want to make a 2 player game myself and a friend can play against each other.
All code written in JavaScript.
Tutorials found on youtube and other online sources to help me make it.

CONTROLS:
P1: 'A' = Move left
    'D' = Move Right
    'W' = Jump

P2: 'ArrowLeft' = Move Left
    'ArrowRight' = Move Right
    'ArrowUp' = Jump
